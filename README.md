# Sample-R-code
These sample R codes in this folder show (1) how to clean survey datasets using Tidyverse packages and (2) how to run regressions using clustered standard errors, create regression outputs as a Latex table, and (3) create coefficient plots. 
These are only a small portion of my R codes.
